## Projects

### 1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

This project demonstrates the implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling tasks. The primary focus is on handling time-series data or sequential data for applications such as language modeling or stock price prediction.

- **Key Features**:
  - Implement RNN models using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - Train and evaluate models on sequential data.
  - Example use case: Predicting the next word in a sentence or forecasting future stock prices.
